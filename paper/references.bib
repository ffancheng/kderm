  abstract  = "[Many statistical methods involve summarizing a probability
               distribution by a region of the sample space covering a
               specified probability. One method of selecting such a region is
               to require it to contain points of relatively high density.
               Highest density regions are particularly useful for displaying
               multimodal distributions and, in such cases, may consist of
               several disjoint subsets-one for each local mode. In this paper,
               I propose a simple method for computing a highest density region
               from any given (possibly multivariate) density f(x) that is
               bounded and continuous in x. Several examples of the use of
               highest density regions in statistical graphics are also given.
               A new form of boxplot is proposed based on highest density
               regions; versions in one and two dimensions are given. Highest
               density regions in higher dimensions are also discussed and
               plotted.]",
