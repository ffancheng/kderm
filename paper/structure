Title: Anomaly detection with kernel density estimation on manifolds

Abstract: 

Keywords: 

- Introduction
	
	Background (anomaly detection with density) with summarised contribution

	Anomaly detection using densities, other methods for anomaly detection. Based manifold learning embeddings, density estimates

	Density estimation methods, KDE with distortion, 2-D variable kernel denstiy estimate with Riemannian matrix

	- Main contributions: better anomaly detection

		fix distortion with Riemmanian matrix

		anomaly detection using density estimates

		kernel density estimate is not accurate

		improve density estimation with distortion in the embedding plot

	Paper structure

- Variable kernel density estimation with manifold embeddings

	Idea: whole process for the main contribution

	Kernel density estimate with Variable bandwidth

	Riemannian matrix to measure distortion

	Use riemannian matrix as variable bandwidth

		Bandwidth is a symmetric positive-definite square matrix, similar to riemannian matrix

	- Manifold learning distortion

		dimension reduction using manifold learning 

		Riemannian matrix to measure topological distortion

		distortion is informative for true embeddings
