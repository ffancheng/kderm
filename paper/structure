Title: Anomaly detection with kernel density estimation on manifolds

Abstract: 

Keywords: 

- Introduction
	
	Background (anomaly detection with density) with summarised contribution

		Anomaly detection on very high-dimensional data. Applications. Main contribution.

	Anomaly detection using densities, other methods for anomaly detection. Based manifold learning embeddings, density estimates

	Density estimation methods, KDE with distortion, 2-D variable kernel denstiy estimate with Riemannian matrix

	- Main contributions: better anomaly detection

		fix distortion with Riemmanian matrix

		anomaly detection using density estimates

		kernel density estimate is not accurate

		improve density estimation with distortion in the embedding plot

	Paper structure

- Variable kernel density estimation with manifold embeddings

	Idea: whole process for the main contribution

	Kernel density estimate with variable bandwidth

	Riemannian matrix could be used to measure distortion

	Use riemannian matrix as variable bandwidth

		Bandwidth is a symmetric positive-definite square matrix, similar to riemannian matrix

	- Manifold learning distortion

		dimension reduction using manifold learning 

		Riemannian matrix to measure topological distortion

		distortion is informative for true embeddings

- Simulation

    - 2-D Meta data from a Gaussian Mixture Model

    Multiple mapping functions: swiss roll, 
    
    Manifold learning results for the mapped 3-D data
        
        ISOMAP, LLE, Laplacian Eigenmaps, t-SNE, UMAP (useful ones, and the one with too severe distortion)
    
    Outlier plot based on density estimates
    
        Fixed bandwidth
        
        Pointwise adaptive bandwidth using Riemmanien
        
        Comparison
            
            Rank of densities with the true density (f=f_1/4 + f_2/4 + f_3/4 + f_4/4)
            Sum of squared errors in the density estimates

    - 5-D data embedding in 100-D space. 4-D from mixture Gaussian kernels (99% from N(0,1), 1% from N(0, 5) to add outliers), 1-D from semi-sphere, all other 95-D as 0, then rotate using the R matrix from QR decomposition to get the 100-D input for manifold learning)

    	The true mixture density is weighted sum of the individual densities from normal distribution.
